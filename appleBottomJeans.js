Bryce Groesbeck, our teacher so true
He teaches us GitHub, a skill we must learn anew
With patience and care, he guides us each day
Helping us navigate, through code and its way

He is always there, to answer a doubt
And when we get stuck, he helps us work it out
He is kind and compassionate, and truly cares
For each of his students, and their hopes and their prayers

We are so grateful, for Bryce Groesbeck's aid
For without him, our journey would not have been made
So here's to you Bryce, our dear teacher and friend
We are lucky to have you, until the very end
